# nextflow-kraken2

A relatively simple metagenomics analysis pipeline written in nextflow [[1]](#1). The pipeline is based on `kraken2` and `bracken`, and is supplemented with `Krona` visualizations and interactive html tables.

## Description

The pipeline runs in a docker container by default. Both Illumina and Nanopore (but not hybrid) data can be processed. For a set of `fastq` files it executes:

- [`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) - filter and trim reads with default parameters
- [`kraken2`](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/) [[2]](#2) - taxonomic assignment of the reads 
- [`bracken`](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/bracken/) [[3]](#3) - abundance estimation at a single level in the taxonomic tree, e.g. species
- [`krona`](https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki) [[4]](#4) - plots are generated from the output of `kraken2`
- [`DataTables`](https://datatables.net/) - generates an interactive HTML table with the results from `bracken` for each sample, as well as a summary table for all the samples

## Installation and running the pipeline

Nothing to install, as soon as you have `docker` and `nextflow`. Choose a `kraken2` database (see below), and run the pipeline:

```bash
# run with a test dataset (included)
nextflow run angelovangel/nextflow-kraken2 -profile test

# see options and how to run
nextflow run angelovangel/nextflow-kraken2 --help

```

For all the arguments and how to use them see the output of `nextflow run angelovangel/nextflow-kraken2 --help`

## Output

All output files are in the folder `results-kraken2`, which is found in the folder with reads data used for running the pipeline. An example of the outputs, generated with a small Illumina dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z6ditk7xsyw9wo4/results-kraken2.zip?dl=0).

The outputs are:

- `timmed_fastq/` - directory with fastq files after trimming, these are also used for taxonomic profiling
- `bracken_summary_heatmap/table.html`- standalone html files with summary information from bracken. Note that these files will be generated only if there are less than 24 samples
- `bracken_summary_long/wide.csv`- summary bracken information (all found taxa in all samples), in different formats
- `kraken2taxonomy_krona.html`-  an interactive Krona plot of the kraken2 output for all samples
- `samples/` - directory with individual (per sample) kraken2 and bracken-corrected report files and with the abundance table from bracken (as html and tsv). *Tip: the report files can be directly imported in [Pavian](https://github.com/fbreitwieser/pavian) for nice interactive visualizations*.

## Choosing a `kraken2` database

This pipeline needs a kraken2 database to run, passed by the `--database` parameter (default is the ftp to the 16S_Greengenes13.5 database <sup>1</sup>). An absolute path to a previously downloaded kraken database (`*.tgz`) file can be passed, as well as an ftp path (`ftp://...`). See the [kraken2 homepage](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/index.shtml?t=downloads) for a list of avalable pre-built databases. These databases have the required Bracken files included (for read lengths 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250). Take care to use the correct `--readlen` parameter according to your reads data.

<sup>1</sup> Although still controversial, [recent work](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.012047v1) has shown that kraken2 may be performing better than QIIME in the analysis of 16S amplicons.
